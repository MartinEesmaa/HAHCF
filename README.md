## Compile the game

To compile the game, you can have two choice to download via Code green button or just git clone it.

You need:

- Windows, macOS or Linux to use Ren'Py to build the game.
- Ren'Py 6.13 or later work (tested [6.13](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.13) & [6.15](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.15)). Original build was used on Ren'Py 6.15.4.320. So I compile legacy builds using Ren'Py 6.13.8.1675 & various versions to work probably.

Step 1: Follow the instructions on Ren'Py.

Step 2: Once you installed Ren'Py on your computer. Download the source code.

If you haven't heard Git before, Git is cloning tool used commonly by programmers, but you can download the project by pressing Code button and then click Download ZIP.

Step 3: Uncompress ZIP file to drag into renpy folder.

Step 4: Launch Ren'Py on your computer and make sure select downloaded project game folder and then you can launch the project or build distributions.

If you're not sure or understand, you can create an issue on GitHub. I feel free to help you. :)
